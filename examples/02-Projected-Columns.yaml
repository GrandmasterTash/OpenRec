name: Projected Columns
description: |
  This charter demonstrates how to create (project) new columns from data taken from existing columns.
  Projected columns are created by using Lua script. The script can reference any other field on the record.
  This new projected column can then be used, for example as part of the grouping criteria.

    # All of the invoices records are using GBP currency, where-as the payments for those invoices are
    # being provided in a variety of currencies. Fortuantely, the loading of the data has populated an
    # exchange rate against each payment, accurate on the payment date.
    #
    # Because we want perform a net-to-zero operation on the data (see 01-Basic-Match.yaml) we need the
    # payment and invoice amounts to match and therefore we use a project to convert the payment amount
    # into the GBP currency equivalent.
    - project:
        # The column field denotes the name for the new projected column. This can be referenced in any
        # subsequent instruction in this charter.
        column: PAYMENT_AMOUNT_BASE
        # We must define the type of this column.
        as_a: Decimal
        # The Lua script below has access to a table called 'record' which is populated with the values of
        # each column from the underlying file. In this case, we are multipling the Amount by the FXRate
        # for the payment to derive a GBP value in a new column called PAYMENT_AMOUNT_BASE.
        #
        # NOTE: Decimal amounts use a precise backing data-type, something not normally possible with standard
        # Lua - which uses floating point numbers - without the aid of additional libraries.
        from: record["PAY.Amount"] * record["PAY.FXRate"]
        # Because we have loaded both invoices and payments into our virtual grid of data
        # (see 01-Basic-Match.yaml), we need to ensure the above Lua is not evaluated against an invoice
        # record in a grid, and only evaluated against a payment record. We can do this either by checking
        # a field on the record which denotes it's type or, if this isn't available, we can use the 'META'
        # prefixed field which set to the field alias defined above. This is a special field set to the
        # (short) filename where the record originated from or, in our case, the field_alias defined above.
        # There are other META. fields available and these are discussed later.
        #
        # NOTE: If we didn't have the following 'when' clause (which is optional), then our from script
        # above, would cause an error as soon as it was evaluated against an invoice record, because
        # invoices don't have a field called 'PAY.Amount' or 'PAY.FXRate'.
        when: record["META.prefix"] == "PAY"

    - project:
        # In this example our payment records have an invoice reference but it's embedded in the payment reference
        # in the format '<pay ref>XX<inv ref>XX'. So we'll project a column for each payment that can extract the
        # invoice reference from the payment reference.
        column: PAYMENT_INV_REF
        # Our output column will be a string data-type.
        as_a: String
        # Here we use the Lua function (https://www.lua.org/pil/20.3.html) to capture the portion of the field
        # we require into a variable called inv_ref then return that variable. Note, the '_' represent values
        # returned from string.find that we do not need (in this case the start and end position of the match).
        # Lua uses it's own regular expression syntax, similar to standard POSIX (https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).
        # In the pattern below, the brackets (.*) capture the value we want to use.
        from: |
          local _start, _end, inv_ref = string.find(record["PAY.Reference"], "^PAY.*XX(.*)XX$")

        # We're merging the (converted) paymount amount and the invoice's total amount into a new column
        # called AMOUNT which we'll use in our group constraints to NET together and test the validity of each group.

        into: AMOUNT

    - merge:
        # Now that values in PAYMENT_IN_REF share the same format as values in INV.Reference, we'll merge
        # the invoice reference and our projected payment's invoice reference (with the Xs removed) into a
        # column to group records together with.
        columns: ['INV.Reference', 'PAYMENT_INV_REF']
        into: REFERENCE

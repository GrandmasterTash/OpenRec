name: NET with Tolerance
description: |
  This example demonstrates a new type of grouping constraint rule. nets_with_tolerance. This is
  similar to the nets_to_zero constraint example you can specify an amount or percentage-based
  tolerance. For example, if exact exchange rates cannot be pinned down at the time of a transaction
  then some fluctuations may be permissible.

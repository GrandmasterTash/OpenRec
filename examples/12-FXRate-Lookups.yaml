name: Exchange Rate Lookup
description: |
  This charter demonstrates how to use an external 'static' CSV file to look-up reference data which
  can be used to transform incoming data files.

  It is essentially example #2 (project columns) repeated, but this time there is no FXRate on the
  original payment record.

  In this case, all of the invoices are in a 'base' GBP currency whilst the payments are in their
  own currency. Jetwash is configured to add a new FXRate column to the payments with the exchange
  rate corresponding to the payment date.

  Before deploying the data to the inbox, be sure to copy all the examples/data/YYYY-MM-DD-GBP-_FXRates.csv
  files in to the lookups folder.

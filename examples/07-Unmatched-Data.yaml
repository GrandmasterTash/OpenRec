name: Unmatched Data
description: |
  This charter demonstrates what occurs when not all data is immediately matched.

  Start by only copying these files into the inbox folder: -
    07-invoices
    07-payments-a.csv

  The invoice file contains two invoices, the payment file contains a full payment for one invoice
  and only a partial payment for the second invoice. So, if run, it will result in an invoice and
  a payment both being written to their own unmatched files. The files will share the same name
  as the original data file that loaded the invoice and reside in the unmatched folder.

  If you are using Steward, you'll see a new outbox folder which contains the unmatched data files.

  Next, copy this file into the inbox folder: -
    07-payments-b.csv


  This file contains the remaining payment information so re-running the charter will match the
  outstanding payment to the unmatched invoice. You should now a second outbox folder with no
  unmatched data present.

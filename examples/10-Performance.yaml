  This charter is intended to demonstrate the low resource requirements for large match jobs. It is intended to be
  used as part of the docker playground - using the small_data.sh and big_data.sh scripts to load data into the control.

  It is important to stress, files copied to the inbox folder SHOULD INITIALLY BE GIVEN A '.inprogress' FILENAME SUFFIX.
  The Steward module will ignore these files until the suffix is removed.

  FAILURE to adhere to the above can lead to large data files becoming corrupted as Jetwash attempts to copy and process
  them prior to the data being fully written.

  Feel free to tweak the number of rows the generator utility creates in the big/small_data.sh scripts.

# Ensure debug is false - there is significant overhead when true as the matcher will be writing all
# data out to multiple files after each instruction if it's set to true.
debug: false

# We're using large data files with this charter so to avoid consuming too much disk space we'll disable archiving.
